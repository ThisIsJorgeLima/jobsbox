<p><strong> About Stansberry Research </strong></p>
<p>Stansberry Research is a subscription-based publisher of financial information and software, serving millions of investors around the world. Our business is guided by two simple principles:</p>
<ul>
<li>We strive to give our customers the information we'd want if our roles were reversed. </li>
<li>We only publish analysts whose advice and strategies we'd want our own families to read and to follow. </li>
</ul>
<p>We believe in offering a range of opinions. Experienced analysts, with their own unique investment strategies and philosophies, lead our franchise brands. As a result, we do not promote a single, unified view of the markets, but instead we publish a mosaic of opinions, recommendations, and strategies. This multi-franchise approach gives our work far greater breadth, creating more diverse opportunities for our subscribers. Our franchises are linked, however, by a continuous commitment to risk management and a contrarian approach to identifying investment opportunities. Across all of our franchises, we focus on investments that are unloved, ignored, or unknown. It is in these situations where having an informed perspective gives our subscribers the best risk-to-reward opportunities.</p>

<p>Would you like to join a highly motivated team on a mission to dramatically improve the lives of people who are battling substance use dependency? 1 out of every 10 Americans is addicted to alcohol or drugs, and yet as few as 1 in 36 people will be in remission 1 year later.</p>
<p>Why? The problem is complex, multi-faceted, and to put it simply: really, really hard to solve.</p>
<p><strong> _ Our mission is 36 out of 36. _ </strong></p>
<p>Triggr Health is the first predictive system of care for addiction recovery. We guide and support individuals on their personalized paths to long-term remission, whenever and wherever they need it. Our core platform utilizes phone sensors and phone data to predict the state of an individual’s recovery in real-time, enabling the right care to be delivered proactively the moment it is needed. Imagine if you could predict risk factors that lead to regressive behavior, such as when someone is angry; when they are experiencing a craving; when they are not sleeping well; or when they are falling off their continuing care plan. Now imagine doing all of this without self-reported data.</p>
<p>Our system combines machine learning with evidence-based care to predict a person’s health and reach them at the optimal time.</p>
<p>We are a world-class team of engineers, designers, doctors, and researchers from institutions such as Stanford, Google, UCSF School of Medicine, UPENN, Northwestern, and Rackspace. We are currently working with many of the top treatment providers, government initiatives, health systems, and academic research programs in the world.</p>
<p>We have come together because we believe that our friends, our family, and every person struggling with a behavioral health condition deserves the best possible care. We are building a world where everyone reaches long-term recovery.</p>

You embrace the hard problems like localization, security, and timezones. You want to move our code, style and performance in the right direction and be an influencer.  </p>
<p>It doesn't matter if it's Ant or Gradle, Struts or Spring, jQuery or GWT - you know it or you can pick it up.

<li>Great programmers are great programmers whether they work in Java, .Net, React Native or C++ </li>

<li>Prior experience with production large-scale distributed systems </li>

TerraCycle
<p>JOB DESCRIPTION:<br />
TerraCycle is seeking an energetic and resourceful Industrial Designer with a passion for green design. Designers at TerraCycle develop concepts, designs, and prototypes for some of the world’s largest brands from their waste. We focus on creating eco-minded products and experiences that help people understand that they too can eliminate the idea of waste.  </p>
<p>QUALIFICATIONS:<br />
- Have a degree in Industrial Design or equivalent experience<br />
- Fluent with 2D and 3D software design tools<br />
- Experience working with Arduino and Raspberry Pi programming languages<br />
- Strong sketching skills and ability to articulate ideas<br />
- Comfortable fabricating with many types of materials ie. wood, plastics, metals, and fabrics<br />
- A working knowledge of sustainable materials, recycled plastics, and closed loop product design<br />
- Having experience is important, but attitude is right up there, too. We want to work with like-minded sunny, personable, ‘yes’ people who are game for tackling far-fetched ideas and turning them into reality.  </p>
<p>ABOUT YOU:<br />
YOUR DEFINITION OF DESIGN IS BROAD. You would enjoy designing everything from recycled plastic products and furniture to soft goods to motion-activated recycling bins and intuitively know the right tools to use for each item.  </p>
<p>YOU ARE COLLABORATIVE BUT SELF-DIRECTED. You enjoy brainstorming with your fellow designers, but are comfortable being independent and requiring minimal guidance.  </p>
<p>YOU ARE ECO-CONSCIOUS. You know what upcycling means and think twice before throwing anything away considering it for an alternative use.  </p>
<p>YOU ARE ATTENTIVE TO DETAIL AND HIGHLY ORGANIZED. You think about how to produce a product while designing it, and understand how to turn your vision into concrete outcomes.  </p>
<p>WHAT TO EXPECT:<br />
Our Design environment is very fast paced and every day is different. You’ll often be called into meetings with our CEO and thrown into a crazy-but-fun new project with an even crazier deadline. We have a colorful and inspiring open office space made with as many waste materials as possible, and an open courtyard in the center where we often have meetings and lunch (sometimes at the same time). Dress code is relaxed and informal, and as a designer you’ll probably be getting messy pretty often, so a spare set of clothes is a good idea.  </p>
<p>This role is currently positioned as a three month trial period.  </p>
<p>COMPENSATION:<br />
- Generous paid time off<br />
- Company subsidized medical plan<br />
- Company matched 401-k contributions<br />
- Salaried position  </p>
<p>About <strong>TerraCycle</strong>:<br />
TerraCycle is an innovative, highly publicized, fast-growth eco company that creates solutions for collecting, recycling and upcycling previously non-recyclable waste.</p>

Desjardins Lab
<p>Tu entres dans une pièce et l’éclairage s’ajuste automatiquement, projetant une vive lumière sur des ordinateurs, un Oculus Rift et d’autres composantes de réalités virtuelles, tablettes, écrans tactiles, tasses réutilisables, biscuits chinois, imprimante 3D et quelques Raspberry Pi rangés dans des armoires en métal-recyclé. Puis, une voix t’invite à t’installer…que fais-tu ?</p>
<p>a) Prudemment tu avances dans la pièce, ton cell en main prêt à appeler à l’aide.</p>
<p>b) Tu sors immédiatement de la pièce. Cet endroit n’est vraiment pas ce que tu cherchais...</p>
<p>c) Tu bondis dans la pièce, excité à l’idée d’explorer et créer avec tous ces outils!</p>
<p>Vous voilà, enfin ! dit la voix, commençons à travailler. Je pensais convertir l’écran tactile en un kiosque d’accueil holographique, utiliser quelques Arduinos pour prototyper le fameux projet Alpha et humm…il faut vraiment régler l’expérience vidéo de réalité virtuelle. Que fais-tu ?</p>
<p>a) Tu commences par chercher dans la pièce les « Arduinos », te demandant de quoi il s’agit : un type d’ordinateur ? des pièces de lego ? des elfes des bois ?</p>
<p>b) Tes yeux s’écarquillent, la panique te gagne et tu peines à articuler : mais…mais…il n’y a que 24 heures dans une journée, non ?!</p>
<p>c) Tu cherches avec frénésie le fameux code WebGL sur Codepen avec lequel tu meurs d’envie de tester différents usages tout en pensant à la discussion que tu auras dans l’appel conférence avec l’équipe et la start-up pour le mandat de réalité virtuelle. Ensuite tu vas jeter un œil dans le GitHub pour les différents projets Arduino que t’as étiqueté piste intéressante à explorer pour alimenter un bon brainstorming avec les coéquipiers pour le projet Alpha…tout en étant guider par la sagesse des biscuits chinois.</p>
<p>La journée tire à sa fin et tes collègues te demandent quels sont tes plans pour la soirée. Quelle serait ta réponse ?</p>
<p>a) Boff…manger, dormir…</p>
<p>b) C’est pas vraiment de vos affaires.</p>
<p>c) Ce soir ? Ce soir, j’aimerais rendre encore plus cool le dernier projet / peut-être aller au rendez-vous techno du club d’entrepreneurs / regarder le demo launch sur Facebook live / sortir avec vous, aller prendre un verre ensemble…ce serait malade!</p>
<p>Si tu as répondu…</p>
<p>Surtout A : Merci pour ton intérêt, mais on ne semble pas fait l’un pour l’autre.</p>
<p>Surtout B : Ne paniquons pas, ce n’est que de la fiction! Décidément nos chemins ne se croiseront pas. Merci tout de même d’avoir eu l’audace de vous rendre jusqu’ici, en reconnaissance voici un clin d’œil.</p>
<p>Surtout C : On veut te rencontrer!</p>

<p>You enter the room and the lights automatically adjust, casting a bright light on the computers, an Oculus rift and other virtual reality gear, tablets, touch screens, compostable cups, fortune cookies, a 3D printer and a few raspberry pis stacked on a recycled-metal shelf. You hear a voice that beckons, inviting you in. What do you do?</p>
<p>a) Cautiously step inside the room, with one hand on your phone, ready to call for help.</p>
<p>b) Back out quickly. This strange room is not what you were looking for…</p>
<p>c) Run in, jump around, you can’t wait to start creating!</p>
<p>“Perfect, you’re here!”, says the voice, “let’s get to work. I’m thinking we convert the touch screens into holographic welcome displays, grab some Arduinos to do some protos for Project Alpha, and hmm.. we really do need to get that VR video going…” What do you do?</p>
<p>a) Tentatively search the room for instructions on what this Arduino thing is. Is it a computer? A project? An elf?</p>
<p>b) <em>eyes grow wide with panic</em>, you shakingly ask, “but…aren’t there only 24 hours in a day..?”</p>
<p>c) Search for that awesome WebGL bit on codepen you saw and have been dying to try out while taking a mental note of the phone call you’ll make to the VR team. After that you’ll check out the github Arduino projects you had tagged as ‘must do someday!’ and set up some time to brainstorm with teammates and startups on what direction to take for Project Alpha, all while snacking on fortune cookies.</p>
<p>It’s nearing the end of the day and your colleague asks you what your plans are for the night. What do you answer?</p>
<p>a) “Um….Sleeping…Eating…Stuff.”</p>
<p>b) “That’s clearly none of your business…”</p>
<p>c) “Tonight? Tonight, I can’t wait to fiddle around with my latest github project / go to that lecture at the tech entrepreneurs club / watch that movie / hangout with you – let’s go for a beer! It will be awesome!”</p>
<p>If you answered…</p>
<p>Mostly A’s: Thank you for your interest, but this just doesn’t seem to be a good fit.</p>
<p>Mostly B’s: We apologize for any panic we may have caused! I think we can mutually agree that this isn’t a match. Please accept this as a token of our appreciation for getting this far.</p>
<p>Mostly C’s: Let’s talk! <a target="_blank" href="mailto:deborah.hayek@desjardins.com"> deborah.hayek@desjardins.com </a></p>

Signal
<p>We want to add a senior engineer to our team at Signal’s Brooklyn office. If you want to join a high-performing engineering team full of awesome people (who doesn’t?), you should keep reading.</p>
<p><strong> A few reasons we’re excited to come to work every day </strong></p>
<p>“We’re making Cassandra scale to the needs of our business (more than 2 billion queries per day and growing)” -Aki (engineering manager)</p>
<p>“Building a distributed Jenkins system, running multiple workers on multiple platforms, to not only run front-end and back-end unit tests, but to also create a pooled set of services to run per developer for long duration, integration and behavior tests.” –John (engineer)</p>
<p>“Our Cassandra Cluster is 60 nodes by five regions. We’re one of the biggest Cassandra deployments that I know of for a company our size. I love that we’re small but mighty, solving the types of problems tackled by much larger teams at Apple or Facebook”. – Jenny (engineer)</p>
<p>“We're switching from using Mongo for storing pending messages to Kafka.  The cool part about this is we're going from mongo's do-anything architecture to a stream-based architecture. This means we can scale a lot easier. Once we roll this out is we go from ~5k messages/sec to 200k+ messages/sec on a quarter the hardware cost.” – Cliff (engineering manager)</p>
<p>“I’m working on the Kafka project. The exciting part is that we can, with a little more work, replace our whole message broker stack with Kafka. We'll be able to show up-to-the-minute stats on how much data we've consumed from the Kafka topic and that will be how we tell if our system is working. It will enable us to react more quickly to problems and sets us up to do some neat machine learning and analytics on our traffic to gain some insights into what's happening in our system.”- Bobby (engineer)</p>
<p><strong> So, what else would you be doing? </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Design practical solutions to solve problems. Write great code. Stay ahead technically.  Participate in code reviews, testing. </li>
<li>Provide the technology for a platform that facilitates billions of requests monthly. </li>
<li>Working with big data and predictive analytics on a distributed system. </li>
<li>Collaborate. You'll be working with everyone—dev team, product owners, client services, to innovate and get stuff done. </li>
<li>Provide back-end connectivity solutions. </li>
<li>Work to help us be the best team we can be by promoting great architectural practices, improving process and always wanting to learn more. </li>
<li>Mentor junior developers </li>
<li>Participate in Hack Week, Shark Week, demo days. Have fun and experience life at a growing tech company. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong> What we need from you </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Extensive programming experience required in Java and GO languages. </li>
<li>Technical skills. You have experience working in large code bases and engineering features that are secure, scalable and highly available. </li>
<li>You’re the type of engineer who likes an impromptu whiteboard session to help others solve their problems. </li>
<li>Sense of curiosity and desire to always be learning. </li>
<li>Deep experience in HTTP, REST, API design and SOA. </li>
<li>You are smart and amazing, but your ego doesn't require you to be the only smart and amazing person on your team. </li>
<li>You are comfortable using source control (Git). </li>
<li>Commitment to testing, code reviews. </li>
<li>A strong preference for open source technologies is a must. </li>
</ul>
<p>Outside the obviousness of the job, like all Signalites you fall in love with new ideas, can’t stop learning, and are a pretty nice person on top of all of it. You get that even the most fun kind of work is work, consider putting in the hours an obvious necessity, and easily deal with change. You think well beyond what’s asked of you, live and breathe the minutiae of the work.</p>
<p><strong> What’s in it for you: </strong></p>
<p>We believe in code quality, testing, peer reviews, collaboration. We believe in using the best tool for the job. We love open source, open communication and have created an environment where we treat people like adults, give them big problems to solve and the power to solve them.</p>
<p>To support this we offer a competitive salary/bonus with great benefits, like: unlimited PTO, 401k, health/dental/vision, STD/LTD, snacks, parental leave, Hack Weeks, great colleagues.</p>

<p>In addition to daily development tasks, you'll be participating in code reviews, working closely with Product Management to flesh out new features, and be given the opportunity to work on all aspects of the application. We follow an agile, Kanban, development methodology, respecting our WIP limits and releasing software in small, iterative, versions 1-2 times per week.</p>

TD Bank Group
<p>At TD,  API Management is a centralized department that oversees all the Enterprise API development by providing governance, guidance, and delivery support.</p>
<p>A major component of the TD IT3.0 strategy is to expose all the various back-end systems across every LOB using HTTP/JSON API's, all built and deployed in a consistent manner -- leveraging tools, guidance, and frameworks/components built by or aggregated by the API Management teams.</p>
<p>This role will involve activities from 2 main areas:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Working with LOB project teams (typically 1-4 groups at a time) to provide guidance and development support for new API builds.  This involves architecture reviews, Agile project execution assistance (Jira, Confluence, Jenkins, Nexus, SONAR), code development, back-end system integration (JMS, MQ, mainframe [IMS &amp; CICS], databases, API, web services, external services, etc). </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Working on internal development initiatives to add new features to the API frameworks (Java, NodeJS), or any of the major initiatives we are working on rolling out (public-facing API's, OAuth, enterprise metrics collection &amp; reporting, identity management and access controls, etc.). </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Essentially, you'll be joining an elite team of hands-on developers in a "Center of Excellence" for API's and OAuth that are helping us continually grow and improve our enterprise-wide best practices, then working to roll that out across the organization.</p>
<p>And, since API's are always built at TD as part of projects that include an API consumer, you'll be getting exposure and experience not only in API's, but also in the front-end consumers and the back-end systems that they expose.</p>
<p>This fast-paced role gives you a very unique view across all the lines of business (LOB) at TD, front-end to back-end data flows, and exposure to migrating legacy systems into the new AngularJS and API-based world.</p>
<p>Btw, did we mention: This group involves all net-new development!</p>
<p><strong> Department Overview </strong></p>
<p>From a technical side, we are responsible for:</p>
<p>- Introducing and rolling out NodeJS as an enterprise API technology to the bank</p>
<p>- Developing, maintaining, and rolling out NodeJS and Java EE frameworks/components for re-use on every API</p>
<p>- Assigning a "dev consultant/advisor" to every LOB API team to help them through the full project life-cycle, from design to development to deployment</p>
<p>- Assembling, setting up, and maintaining a cutting-edge DevOps set of tools used internally by API Management, as well as shared by many of the LOB teams, including: Confluence, Jira, Jenkins, Nexus, Veracode, Cloudify</p>
<p>- Defining and rolling out the OAuth 2.0 strategy for authentication and authorization across every TD enterprise API, and all the consuming applications</p>
<p>- Developing an expertise in TD Cloud deployment using TOSCA blueprints and Salt scripts, and helping LOB teams deploy their API's into TD Cloud across DEV/SIT/PAT/PROD environments</p>
<p>- Build and provide a strong understanding of load balancing (local and cross-data-center), performance testing, vulnerability scanning &amp; assessment, session management, enterprise data modeling (RAML/Swagger), API versioning, TLS, etc.</p>
<p><strong> Skills &amp; Requirements </strong></p>
<p>NodeJS technical skills:</p>
<p>- JavaScript development skills</p>
<p>- Developing server-side and API development using NodeJS, Express</p>
<p>- NodeJS API's will be developed using loopback.io and Strongloop frameworks</p>
<p>- Testing: mocha, chai, sinon, supertest</p>
<p>- Performance testing: run and optimize performance of API's and back-ends using tools like JMeter, SOATest, Load Test</p>
<p>Java technical skills:</p>
<p>- Java core development skills (we'll be working in Java 6 through 8)</p>
<p>- Java EE: will involve some combination of Spring, JAX-RS, Servlets, Jersey -- pending the project</p>
<p>- Java containers: deploying and maintaining apps in managed containers (JBoss, WebSphere), and some light-weight containers</p>
<p>- Testing: jUnit, Mockito</p>
<p>Consulting skills:</p>
<p>- Ability to work on projects at multiple levels: helping review and advise on high-level architecture, acting as a hands-on developer, and helping push best practices and guidance into the project while still ensuring timelines and core deliverables are met</p>
<p>- Help identify new "integration patterns" and challenges that we should provide enterprise-wide guidance and solutions for, then helping define and document what those are</p>
<p>Initiative leadership:</p>
<p>- We're looking for people who work well in a team environment, but can play strong, independent roles in leading the numerous technical initiatives we have going on in our department</p>
<p>- Some of these include centralized enterprise metrics collection and reporting; exposing public-facing API's, API gateway's, API portals, OAuth and authorization proliferation, and many more...</p>

<p>Bluebeam Software makes smart, simple solutions for paperless workflows that leverage the PDF format. It all started way back in 1997, when we developed CAD to PDF creation technology for aerospace engineers. Now our award-winning PDF creation, markup and editing solutions are used by the world's top architecture, engineering and construction firms, as well as government agencies. We also have a strong following among tablet PC users, students and educators, accountants and even lawyers.</p>
<p>_ Go Figure! _</p>
<p>When it comes to developing innovative products, our philosophy is quite simple. We don't just create "easy-to-use" software, we design ways that make our software feel like second-nature. So, we're relentlessly working to mimic the way you normally work with pen and paper. We also avoid complex jargon and "corporatey" policies like the plague. In fact, we're confident you'll find Bluebeam to be a breath of fresh air, and appreciate that our people do everything they can to lend you a helping hand.</p>
<p>Speaking of Bluebeam employees, we're one big group of corporate misfits, and proud of it! We refuse to be confined by preconceived notions of what PDF software can and should do. We like to shake things up, tear 'em apart and make them our own. Or, completely ignore what others have done and make our own path. Our employees come from diverse technical and artistic backgrounds, and we've even been known to convert Bluebeam users into Bluebeam employees.</p>
<p>If you like to work hard, make a real impact and have a good time in the process, there just might be a place for you on our team.</p>
<p>Bluebeam offers competitive compensation as well as an annual incentive bonus based on performance. Our excellent benefits package includes medical, dental, disability, and life insurance, 401k, and paid time off.</p>
